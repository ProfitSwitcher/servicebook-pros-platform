This document summarizes the successful resolution of backend integration issues for the ServiceBook Pros platform. The platform is now fully functional, with all major features tested and verified.




## âœ… **Backend Integration Fixes**

### 1. **API Route Registration**
- **Issue**: Incorrect route definitions with duplicate prefixes (e.g., `/api/auth/auth/login`) were causing 404/405 errors.
- **Fix**: Corrected all route definitions by removing the duplicate prefixes, ensuring all endpoints are accessible at their intended paths.

### 2. **Authentication System**
- **Issue**: A missing `SECRET_KEY` configuration was preventing JWT token generation and causing login failures.
- **Fix**: Added a `SECRET_KEY` to the Flask application configuration, enabling proper JWT token signing and validation.

### 3. **Demo Data Initialization**
- **Issue**: The demo data scripts were attempting to use fields that did not exist in the `Company` and `User` models, causing database initialization errors.
- **Fix**: Updated the demo data scripts to match the current database schema, ensuring that the demo data can be loaded successfully.




## âœ… **Frontend & Mobile App Verification**

### Frontend Dashboard

- **Dashboard**: Loaded successfully with real-time data from the backend API.
