32 Watt T8 4 Bulb 48 In Rapid Start Ballast

Ballasts are used to energize fluorescent bulbs. Although rapid start ballast do not contribute to the flicker and buzzing found in magnetic ballasts fixtures and are instant on, they use more power by preheating the bulbs than todays electronic ballasts and are not suitable for cold weather. It may be time to consider upgrading your fixture to electronic ballasts or upgrade the complete fixture to led for energy savings
