# Customers Page Crash Fix

## Issue
The Customers page was causing the application to crash with a blank screen when clicked, and after refresh, users were redirected back to the login page.

## Root Cause
The `CustomersPage.jsx` component was missing the React import statement, which caused the component to crash when trying to use React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

## Fix Applied
1. **Added missing React import** to `CustomersPage.jsx`:
   ```javascript
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
   ```

2. **Verified other components** for similar issues and confirmed `LazyComponents.jsx` already had proper React imports.

## Result
- The Customers page should now load properly without crashing
- Authentication state will be preserved when navigating between pages
- Users will no longer be redirected to login after accessing the Customers page

## Testing
The fix has been applied and the frontend has been rebuilt and redeployed. Please test the Customers page functionality again.
