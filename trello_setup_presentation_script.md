"You might be wondering - why Trello? Why not Jira or Azure DevOps? Great question! Here's why Trello is perfect for our project:

**Visual Workflow Management:**
Trello's Kanban-style boards give us instant visibility into what's happening across the entire project. No more wondering 'What's the status of the payment API?' - you can see it moving through our workflow in real-time.

**Simplicity Meets Power:**
While other tools can be overwhelming, Trello strikes the perfect balance. It's simple enough that everyone can use it effectively, but powerful enough with automation and integrations to handle our complex project needs.

**Collaborative by Design:**
Every card becomes a conversation. Comments, attachments, checklists - everything is in one place. When Sarah finishes the database schema, she can immediately notify the API team with context and documentation.

**Flexible and Adaptable:**
As our project evolves, we can easily adjust our workflow. Need a new list for security reviews? Done in 30 seconds. Want to add custom fields for story points? No problem.

**Cost-Effective:**
Unlike enterprise tools that cost hundreds per user, Trello gives us enterprise-level functionality at a fraction of the cost."

**Testing Philosophy:**
Instead of using separate tools like Postman, we're managing all testing within Trello. This keeps everything centralized and provides complete traceability from requirements to test results.

**Test Case Structure:**
Each API endpoint gets its own test card with:
- **Test Objective:** What we're validating
- **Request Details:** Method, URL, headers, body
- **Expected Response:** Status codes, response structure
- **Validation Criteria:** Specific checks to perform
- **Test Steps:** Step-by-step execution guide

**Test Categories:**
1. **Happy Path Tests (🟢):** Normal operation scenarios
   - Create invoice with valid data
   - List invoices with pagination
   - Update invoice status

2. **Edge Cases (🟡):** Boundary conditions
   - Maximum line items per invoice
   - Minimum required fields
   - Date range limits

3. **Error Scenarios (🔴):** Validation and error handling
   - Invalid authentication
   - Missing required fields
   - Business rule violations

4. **Performance Tests (⚡):** Load and stress testing
   - 50 concurrent users creating invoices
   - Response time under 500ms
   - Graceful degradation under load

5. **Security Tests (🔒):** Vulnerability assessment
   - SQL injection attempts
   - Authentication bypass testing
   - Multi-tenant data isolation

**Test Execution Workflow:**
Tests move through their own workflow:
**Test Cases → Ready for Testing → In Progress → Passed/Failed → Bug Fixes (if needed)**

**Results Documentation:**
Every test execution gets documented with:
- Request and response details
- Validation results
- Performance metrics
- Screenshots or error logs
- Overall pass/fail status

**Example Test Card:**
[Show detailed test card for POST /invoices endpoint]
