### Automation Rules (Butler)

```
When a card is moved to "Code Review", add the "👀 Code Review" label
When a card is moved to "Testing", add the "🧪 Testing" label
When a card is moved to "Done", add the "✅ Complete" label and remove all other labels
Every Monday at 9:00 AM, create a card "Weekly Planning Meeting" in "📋 API Planning & Design"
```
